## Description 

These are Michael Hanson's solutions to unique algorithm challenges on codesignal.com. This is the React showcase version.

### Deployment

In order for this React app's pages to route properly when hosted on GitHub Pages, links need to be updated to include the repo's name (for instance, '/codesignal-projects-react-showcase' instead of '/') when deployed. This includes href attributes, value of 'to' in Link components, and 'path' of Route components. Affected files are App.js, Landing.js, and Nav.js. This needs to be kept in mind when switching between running the app locally vs. on GitHub pages.
